Title: Regularized Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
BugReports: https://github.com/shabbychef/rnnmf/issues
Description: A proof of concept implementation of regularized non-negative matrix factorization optimization.
    A non-negative matrix factorization factors non-negative matrix Y approximately as L R, for non-negative
    matrices L and R of reduced rank. This package supports such factorizations with weighted objective and
    regularization penalties. Allowable regularization penalties include L1 and L2 penalties on L and R,
    as well as non-orthogonality penalties. This package provides multiplicative update algorithms, which are
    a modification of the algorithm of Lee and Seung (2001)
    <http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1861-algorithms-for-non-negative-matrix-factorization.pdf>, as well
    as an additive update derived from that multiplicative update.  See also Pav (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2410.22698>.
